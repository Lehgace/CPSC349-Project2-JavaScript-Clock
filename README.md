# CPSC349-Project2-JavaScript-Clock

Joshua Erickson CPSC 392 Project 2 

Create a Digital seconds clock using Set Interval and Date Object in javasript. 
The Date object can be used to get the date, time, hours, and seconds which can be update using set Interval. 
Try to keep the UI Good looking.
    
Goal of design is to show a panel from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure where Dio tells the user the time (in seconds, then as normal 12-hour format time) through the two speech bubbles.
Everything is a JoJo reference.
